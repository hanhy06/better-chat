BetterChat for Fabric

BetterChat is a Fabric mod designed to enhance the chat experience on Minecraft servers. It makes communication between players more dynamic and convenient with features like Markdown-style text formatting, player mentions, and mention notifications & history.

‚ú® Key Features

* **Markdown-Style Chat Formatting:** Emphasize your messages with various text styles.

  **Bold Text**

  _Italic Text_

  ~~Strikethrough Text~~

* **HEX Color Code Support:** Freely apply any color to your text using the `#RRGGBB` format.

* **Player Mention System:** Use the `@` symbol to mention other players.

* **Notification:** Mentioned players who are online will hear a notification sound.

* **Team Colors:** If a mentioned player is on a team, their name will be displayed in their team's color.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Sample `betterchat_config.json`

{
  "textPostProcessingEnabled": true,
  "mentionEnabled": true,
  "defaultMentionColor": "0xFFFF55",
  "defaultMentionSound": "minecraft:entity.experience_orb.pickup"
}
```

### Configuration Options

### Troubleshooting & FAQ

* **Mod Does Not Load:**

  1. Ensure you have the correct Fabric Loader version installed (check `.minecraft/versions` folder).
  2. Confirm that Fabric API and BetterChat `.jar` files are both in the `mods` folder.
  3. Check the server/client logs for errors related to BetterChat during startup.

* **Color Formatting Not Applying:**

  1. Verify `textPostProcessingEnabled` is set to `true` in `betterchat_config.json`.
  2. Make sure your HEX color syntax is correct: wrap text as `#RRGGBBYour Message#`.

* **Mentions Not Notifying Players:**

  1. Confirm `mentionEnabled` is `true`.
  2. Ensure the mentioned player is online to hear the notification sound; offline mentions will be stored instead.
  3. If the player is on a team, the mention color will default to the team's color rather than `defaultMentionColor`.
